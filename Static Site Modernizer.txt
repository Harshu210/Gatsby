Requirement: 

Transform static website into a modern, dynamic and content-flexible website (which can change content n number of times)

Proposed Solution:

1)A CMS can be integrated for dynamic content management 





Recommended - Payload



Reasons for Payload CMS:





100% open source



Modern Tech Stack (Integrates easily with frameworks like react)



Easy for Non-Technical users to manage content( like add/edit/delete content)



Includes plugins, themes



Auto-generates REST and GraphQL APIs - no extra setup needed



Performs better even for high-demand applications



Easy to customize schema, logic and behavior entirely through code



SEO-friendly

Other Alternatives - 





Strapi





Open source



Quick setup with some customization



More beginner friendly



GUI for schema creation



Easy for non-tech

Why not Stapi





less flexible for custom backend logic



struggles with high traffic and complex data relationships at scale



lacks full customization - requires third-party plugins for advanced features



complex for deep integrations 



Sanity





Great for structured content and collaboration



Strong React integration



Real-Time Collaboration (Multiple users can edit content simultaneously)



Powerful Querying (Uses GROQ for advanced content querying and filtering)

Why not Sanity



Difficult for non-tech users



complex schema(since GROQ is needed)



free tier is limited (costs can grow with usage)



external hosting required



WordPress





easy for non-tech users



large plugin ecosystem



quick setup



SEO-friendly

Why not WordPress



can be slow(if too many plugins used)



security risks



not ideal for complex projects



outdated tech(PHP,MYSQL)



difficult to customize deeply without using plugins

2) Static website Generator 





Recommended - Gatsby



Reasons for Gatsby





open source



uses React to build fast, SEO-friendly websites.



pulls data from various sources (like CMSs, APIs, or markdown files) using GraphQL, a powerful query language that lets you request exactly the data you need. 



Gatsby then pre-builds all pages at build time into static files. 



This results in fast loading, optimized images, and strong security, since there's no server-side processing needed after deployment.

Other Alternatives:





Hugo





A fast static site generator built with Go



simple setup



ideal for blogs and documentation sites.



open source

Why not Hugo





Hugo has fewer plugins and integrations



Hugo is static-first, so handling dynamic content requires extra effort - which is a big drawback



Jekyll





Ruby-based 



 integrates well with GitHub Pages



commonly used for blogs and personal websites.

Why not Jekyll





slow with large sites



no built-in content management interface( difficult for non-tech)



requires rebuilding the site whenever content changes



less suitable for larger, dynamic websites or apps with complex requirements



Docker Commands for Running a PostgreSQL Container





docker ps Lists all running Docker containers.



docker ps -a Lists all containers, including stopped ones.



docker run --name postgres-testing -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -e POSTGRES_USER=username -e POSTGRES_DB=postgres -p 5432:5432 -d postgres 

Runs a new PostgreSQL container named postgres-testing with custom user, password, and DB, exposing port 5432



Running Payload CMS with PostgreSQL Locally





npx create-payload-app Creates a new Payload CMS project



postgres://username:password@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres A PostgreSQL connection string specifying user postgres, password password, host 127.0.0.1, port 5432, and database postgres



cd ./file_name Changes the directory to newly created Payload CMS project folder



npm run dev Starts development server for Payload CMS app.



Connecting Gatsby + Payload CMS (using Apollo Client)





npm install @apollo/client graphql

 





Successfully integrated Gatsby and Payload CMS



Content, including text and media blocks, is being successfully retrieved from Payload CMS and integrated into Gatsby.
